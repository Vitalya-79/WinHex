#.NET Wrapper for WinHex API#
[WinHex](https://x-ways.net/winhex/) is in its core a universal hexadecimal editor, particularly helpful in the realm of computer forensics, data recovery, low-level data processing, and IT security.

It has great [WinHex API](https://x-ways.net/winhex/api/) (application programming interface) allows to use the advanced capabilities of the WinHex hex & disk editor programmatically from your programs. In particular, it provides a convenient and simple interface for random access to files and disks at the sector level. It will work with any media that WinHex itself is able to access.

This project is a managed wrapper for WinHex API. You can use [compiled dlls](https://github.com/kcherenkov/WinHex/downloads) or insert *WinHex.cs* into your code and directly call it\`s methods. Don\`t forget to put *whxapi.dll* into release folder.
